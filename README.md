## IMPORTANT NOTICE

We went live with our AI on 1. Sept 2016. This caused a broken git commit
history and a necessary hard rebase. If your Fork does not contain the
`:balloon: AI History starts here` on its `master` branch, please delete
it and re-fork it again.

We hope that this will not occur again in future, so far the new git
history and the merge flow (using `theirs` merge strategy on above
mentioned commit) appears to be stable.

Thank you for your understanding.


## Work-in-Progress (aka alpha)

These are the things that we are currently working on:

- lychee.ai.neat (ES/HyperNEAT AI) is being refactored and unstable.
- lychee.js Studio is being refactored and unstable.
- lychee.js Guide is subject to change (to integrate new AI stack).

- [@humansneednotapply](https://github.com/humansneednotapply) is the account used by our software bots.


lychee.js is a [Next-Gen Isomorphic Application Engine](https://lychee.js.org/#!vision)
that offers a complete solution for prototyping, development,
maintenance and deployment of applications. The underlying
technology stack does not matter (HTML5, WebGL, OpenGL,
OpenGLES, libSDL) and is completely automated behind the
scenes.


## Features

The lychee.js Engine aims to deliver Total Automation through
Artificial Intelligence and better Software Architecture.

Everything listed here requires zero lines of code overhead
and is already fully integrated in the [lychee.js Boilerplate](./projects/boilerplate):

The lychee.js Core and Definition System:

- Isomorphic Application Engine (runs pretty much everywhere)
- Language is only ES5/ES6 JavaScript Code, nothing else
- Composite Pattern inspired Entity/Component System
- Definition System embraces Simplicity and Feature Detection
- Sandboxing System embraces automated Error Reports, Analytics and Debugging
- Serialization System allows Re-Simulation on any Platform
- Built-In Offline Storage Management and Network Synchronization

The lychee.js Software Bots:

- Graphical Asset Management and Entity/Scene Design Tool ([Studio](/projects/lycheejs-studio))
- Graphical Project Management and Server Maintenance Tool ([Ranger](/projects/lycheejs-ranger))
- Command-Line Continous Integration Server ([Harvester](/libraries/harvester))
- Command-Line Wizard for Projects and Libraries ([Breeder](/libraries/breeder))
- Command-Line Builder and Cross-Compiler ([Fertilizer](/libraries/fertilizer))
- Command-Line Fuzz-Tester and Code-Refactorer ([Strainer](/libraries/strainer))

Features of the lychee.js Software Bots:

- Automated Code Refactoring, Bug Fixing and Code Improvements
- Automated Design Tracking, Layout and Flow Optimization
- Automated Packaging for Embedded, Console, Mobile, Desktop and Server Apps
- Automated Deployment via git and Live-Updates
- Automated Reactive/Responsive UI/UX Components
- Automated Debugging, Network and UI/UX Flow Analysis
- Automated Testing and Integration with the AI
- Automated Networking (Peer-to-Peer HTTP1.1/2.0 and WS13 with Local/Global Discovery)
- Automated Network Services and Traffic Balancing/Sharding



## Workflow

Every (not sandboxed) lychee.js Harvester is connected to the
lychee.js Peer Cloud and is contributing to the evolutionary
AI's knowledge and improves its capabilities for all others.

The lychee.js Engine uses backpropagated ES/HyperNEAT as an
evolutionary AI that is connected to a Botnet of lychee.js
Harvesters. Each and every Definition written in lychee.js
contributes to the AI so that it can predict, suggest and
improve all other Projects.

The development process is optimized for Blink-based web
browsers (Chromium, Google Chrome, Opera) and their
developer tools. We honestly recommend NOT using Firefox
due to lack of developer and debugging tools nor has it
any remote debugging protocol.



## Platform / Fertilizer Support

The target platforms are described as so-called Fertilizers.
Those Fertilizers cross-compile everything automagically
using a serialized `lychee.Environment` that is setup in
each project's or library's `lychee.pkg` file.


| Target       | Fertilizer                   | Package   | armv7 |  x86  | x86\_64 |
|:-------------|:-----------------------------|:----------|:-----:|:-----:|:-------:|
| Browser      | html                         | zip, html |   x   |   x   |    x    |
| GNU/Linux    | html-nwjs, node, node-sdl    | bin       |   x   |   x   |    x    |
| OSX          | html-nwjs, node, node-sdl    | app, bin  |       |       |    x    |
| Windows      | html-nwjs, node, node-sdl    | exe       |       |   x   |    x    |
| Android      | html-webview, node, node-sdl | apk, bin  |   x   |   x   |    x    |
| BlackberryOS | html-webview, node, node-sdl | apk, bin  |   x   |   x   |    x    |
| FirefoxOS    | html-webview                 | zip       |   x   |   x   |    x    |
| iOS          | html                         |           |   x   |       |         |
| Ubuntu Touch | html-webview, node           | deb, bin  |   x   |   x   |    x    |

The iOS Fertilizer has currently no support for cross-compilation
due to XCode's gcc limitations. You can still create an own WebView
iOS App and use the `html` platform adapter.



## Quickstart

This is the it-works-failsafe guide of how to install the lychee.js
Engine on your development machine. For everything related to Bundles,
Dev Ops, Security, Deployments and Virtualization - please consult the
[lychee.js Guide](https://github.com/Artificial-Engineering/lycheejs-guide.git).


![Quickstart](./guides/asset/quickstart.gif)


**1) Installation**

The Net Installer automatically installs the lychee.js Engine
on any UNIX-compatible machine (arm, x86 or amd64). The only
requirements beforehand are working `bash`, `curl` and `git`.

The lychee.js Engine installation requires at least 2GB of free
memory space at `/opt/lycheejs`. 4GB are recommended to have a
fully working AI knowledge integration.

Depending on your internet connection speed, the installation
will take a couple minutes (needs to download ca. 500MB zip
file of runtime binaries which is hosted in the releases section
of the [lycheejs-runtime](https://github.com/Artificial-Engineering/lycheejs-runtime/releases)
repository).

Notes:

- **Windows** is **unsupported** as development host. Use a VM, the [Docker Image](https://hub.docker.com/r/cookiengineer/lycheejs) or the [Dockerfile](https://github.com/Artificial-Engineering/lycheejs-bundle/blob/master/bin/package/docker/Dockerfile) instead.
- GNU/Linux requires either of `apt-get`, `dnf`, `pacman`, `yum` or `zipper` installed beforehand.
- Mac OSX requires [brew](https://brew.sh) installed beforehand.
- FreeBSD/NetBSD requires `pkg` installed and [Linux Compatibility](https://www.freebsd.org/doc/handbook/linuxemu-lbc-install.html) activated beforehand.


```bash
# Install lychee.js Engine into /opt/lycheejs
sudo bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://lychee.js.org/install.sh)";
```


**2) Bootup**

The `lycheejs-harvester` integrates all projects with the
Software Bots. Start the `development` profile and open
`http://localhost:8080` in your Blink-based Browser.

```bash
cd /opt/lycheejs;

# Bootup lychee.js Harvester
lycheejs-harvester start development;
```


**3) Integration**

The lychee.js Project is tightly integrated with our
Artificial Intelligence, which is represented by the account
[@humansneednotapply](https://github.com/humansneednotapply).

If you want to have our AI to learn and improve from your project
(read the LICENSE section for caveats first), you need to create a
[Personal Access Token](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
with `repo` rights and put the token in the `.github/TOKEN` file:

```bash
cd /opt/lycheejs;

echo "MY-PERSONAL-ACCESS-TOKEN" > .github/TOKEN;
```

Then you must add the account [@humansneednotapply](https://github.com/humansneednotapply)
to your lychee.js Project's repository collaborators in its
`Settings > Collaborators & teams` section.

![Collaborators Settings](./guides/asset/quickstart-collaborators.png)

Notes:

- You need to add @humansneednotapply to each of your lychee.js Projects' repositories.
- You do **not** need to add @humansneednotapply to your lychee.js Fork.
