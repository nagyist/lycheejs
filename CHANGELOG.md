# lychee.js CHANGELOG

All lychee.js versions are released in a quarterly release cycle.

At the end of each quarter, a new release is automatically 
generated, tagged and pushed to GitHub.

We do NOT use semantic versioning as it is assumed to always use
at least the latest quarterly release on the `master` branch or
the `development` branch.

As we cannot influence decisions of our Artificial Intelligence,
some things might break temporarily on the `development` and
`humansneednotapply` branch.

The update behaviour is changed as explained in the
[RELEASE Guide](./guides/RELEASE.md). All entries in the changelog
are listed in this specific order: `changed`, `removed`, `added`
and `fixed`.
